# Employee_Attrition
Classifying data based on attrition 


An employee attrition data to predict the likelihood of employee retention.
The following points should be noted:
(1)   Since the data splits the employees into two: those who have left and existing employees,
      It is necessary to first add an 'Attrition' column and then bring them together as one solid dataset.
      This is done using the '.append()' method.
(2)   There's need to visualize the data being described. Hence a chart is made and summary statistics.
(3)   Categorical columns from the data are encoded
